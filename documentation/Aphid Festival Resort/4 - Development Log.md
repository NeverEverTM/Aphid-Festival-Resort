## Current Work (0.1.4v)
- 1.4 Wider interactions for aphids, such as with structures, items, other aphids or the player itself
- 1.4 The base support for trait system + skills

## Bug Tracker:

- Music can stop and not come back when leaving to main menu and going back to resort, comes back after you pause and unpause
- Furniture clips below cliff floor, not a big deal but it annoys me big time
- when leaving kitchen, recipe is lost if it was not taken
- tween of world lighting should be instant on main menu and on game load rather than tween from the default day state
- controls are not being binded on startup, tho they are saved and loaded correctly [BEING DONE]

## Technical
- Fix outline shader to render as a single sprite
- Organize sprite folders and allow load of subfolders in database startups (SFX already does this)
- Refactor OptionsManager to work with easily adjustable config slot modules
- Save System should allow the saving of individual global data instead of doing a full save
- Experiment with binary saving
## Gameplay
- Setting: Camera smoothing
- Setting: Skip Intro Cinematic
- Setting: Auto-run
- Resolution Settings
## Music
- Night theme (1 or 2 songs)
- Project Color jingle
- Aphid Death jingle
- Possible Shop themes?
## Misc
- game intro Project Color lacks polish, it requires a bright white flash transition into full logo and motted bg, with small jingle
- change build more to be integrated with free camera instead
- add whistling animation
- add step sounds
- different color for harvest outline + particles
- New paint of coat for some menus, including new art
- Portraits for shop owners
