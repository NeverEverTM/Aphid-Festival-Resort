Here is described the roadmap for most feature implementations, this does not include extra content that may be introduced or general accessibility/quality of life updates.

April 25th was the deadline for Version 0.1
September 2024 is the estimated deadline for Version 0.2 <- aint making this one chief
Hoping to make it before the end of this year and start work on 0.3 on early 2025
+ I may split 0.4 into two parts so 0.5 will be the tournaments and minigames update
+ Same thing with 0.3 complex aphid behaviors, and it'll be diluated among posterior versions
## Version 0.1 ([100%])
- Base aphids, able to breed and mix-match, complex behaviour.
- Multiple savefiles capacity
- The goddang base game
## Version 0.2 (25%)
- [DONE] Cooking mechanics similar to that in the game
- [DONE] Resort customization with the ability to place furniture
- Aphid able to learn skills through small minigames within the resort grounds
- Aphid interactables, such as toys.
## Version 0.3
- Resort interactions, such as trading, selling or releasing aphids.
- More complex Aphid behaviour: Traits, Abilities and Relationships
- Proper story and character interactions, introduction scene and tutorial.
## Version 0.4
- Golden Settlement map (may or may not include most functionality)
- Special Aphid genetics manipulation functionality
## Version 0.5
- Major minigames, similar to Chao tournaments, that use Aphids skills
- Main game loop complete
## Version 0.X+ and forward
- General polish, mechanic completion and QoL updates

## Misc Ideas
+ Maybe Aphids skin parts change color slightly depending on what you feed them?
  Could be skill related too
+ Rework in aphid states needs to account for traits, thinking of a "trait apply" structure, where each trait loads themselves in states, and then states check if they have any to apply
+ aphid trading will be either daily procedurally generated aphids by the game or with other players via qr codes
